Welcome to the official LianWord blog! We're excited to share our journey in revolutionizing language learning through the power of common Sino-Korean vocabulary.

## What Is Common Sino-Korean Vocabulary?

Cognates are words in different languages that share a common origin and similar meanings. For example:

- **Korean:** "전화" → **Chinese:** "电话" - **Japanese:** でんわ/電話 - **Vietnamese:** điện thoại/電話
- **Korean:** "의견" → **Chinese:** "意见" - **Japanese:** いけん/意見 - **Vietnamese:** ý kiến/意見
- **Korean:** "사용" → **Chinese:** "使用" - **Japanese:** しよう/使用 - **Vietnamese:** sử dụng/使用

## How LianWord Works

LianWord leverages these natural connections across Sino-Korean cultural sphere languages to help you:

1. **Recognize familiar patterns** - Your brain already knows more than you think!
2. **Build vocabulary faster** - Start with what you know and expand naturally
3. **Learn like a child** - Intuitive, contextual learning instead of rote memorization
