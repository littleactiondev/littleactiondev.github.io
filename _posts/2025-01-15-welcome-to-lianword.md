Welcome to the LianWord blog! We're excited to share our journey in revolutionizing language learning through the power of cognates.

## What Are Cognates?

Cognates are words in different languages that share a common origin and similar meanings. For example:

- **English:** "telephone" → **Korean:** "전화 (jeonhwa)"
- **English:** "computer" → **Japanese:** "コンピューター (konpyūtā)"
- **English:** "music" → **Chinese:** "音乐 (yīnyuè)"

## How LianWord Works

LianWord leverages these natural connections between languages to help you:

1. **Recognize familiar patterns** - Your brain already knows more than you think!
2. **Build vocabulary faster** - Start with what you know and expand naturally
3. **Learn like a child** - Intuitive, contextual learning instead of rote memorization

## Why It Matters

Traditional language learning often feels like starting from scratch. But with LianWord, you're building on the foundation of words and concepts your brain has already internalized. This approach:

- Reduces cognitive load
- Increases retention
- Makes learning more enjoyable
- Accelerates your progress
